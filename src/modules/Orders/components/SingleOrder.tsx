                  Wash the chicken breast and cut into medium-size chunks. Apply
                  salt, mustard oil, lemon juice, and red chilli powder on the
                  chicken pieces and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. Combine the
                  coriander leaves, spinach, mint leaves, ginger, garlic, and
                  green chillies. Grind into a smooth paste. Now, add curd and
                  spices. Coat the chicken pieces very well in it. Cover the
                  marinated chicken and keep it aside at least for 20 minutes.

                  Soak the wooden skewers in normal water for about 4-5 minutes.
                  Apply some oil on the skewers and arrange the pieces of
                  chicken onto the skewers. Spread some more oil on top of the
                  chicken pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Preheat the oven to 350Â° F for 5 minutes and place the skewers
                  in the oven. Leave to grill for about 15-18 minutes. Keep
                  checking and turn the skewer sticks to cook evenly from all
                  sides. Grill until the chicken is well done.
